<h1>Project: Spark and Data lake</h1>


<h3>Introduction</h3>
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.


<h3>Project Description</h3>
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. You'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

<h3>How to run: ETL Pipeline</h3>

 - Add AWS credentials and S3 target bucket endpoint in dl.cfg
 - Install pyspark and run etl.py python script
 - etl.py ETL:

    - process_song_data

        - Load raw data from S3 buckets to Spark server and process song dataset to insert record into songs and artists dimension table
            
    - process_log_data

        - Load raw data from S3 buckets to Spark stonealone server and Process event(log) dataset to insert record into time and users dimension table and songplays fact table


<h4>Song Dataset</h4>
    
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
    
<code>song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json</code>


<h4>Log Dataset</h4>

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
    
    
 <code>log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json</code>
